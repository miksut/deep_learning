Use this directory to store the datasets. Specifically, create a separate folder for every of the required datasets. These datasets are mentioned in the scipts (see directory `/deep_learning/src`). 

For example, the script `04_multi_output_regression.py` requires a [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance#) whose file path resolves to `data/student/student-mat.csv`.
